task 1: Fibonacci Sequence.
This program first prompts the user to enter a positive integer and validates the input using the validateInput method. The validation loop ensures that the user enters a positive integer, and displays appropriate error messages if the input is invalid.
The printTheSequence method generates and prints the Fibonacci sequence up to the number entered by the user. It initializes the variables a and b with the first two Fibonacci numbers (0 and 1), and then iteratively calculates the subsequent numbers using a loop.
The program follows a modular structure with clear variable names and comments to enhance readability and maintainability.

task 2: Finding Largest Difference between any two numbers in the list.
In this implementation, we initialize the minimun number(min) variable with the first element of the list. Then, we iterate through the list starting from the second element. For each element, we update the minimun number(min) and calculate the difference between the currentNumb and min. Finally, we update the maxDiff if the calculated difference is greater than the current maxDiff. After iterating through the entire list, we return the maxDiffer.
